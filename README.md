# First steps 

* First of all, all scenes can only include material from one of these repos, https://github.com/DRincs-Productions?q=daz&type=all&language=&sort= (if you find other useful material request it from me [here](Request-new-material) )

* Download this project through [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) so you can share your work. [READ MORE](Instructions-to-Download)

* (Recommended) In case you are working on several projects, I recommend splitting the assert folders, as shown below:

* The following repos will also be essential:
 - https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/ABFD-assert (Where the characters and environments will be)
 - https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/daz-assert-pose#readme (for you fundamental)
 - https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/daz-assert-props-pose (for you fundamental)
 - https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/daz-assert-character-tool (assert employees)

 - https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/daz-assert-home  (assert employees)

## Instructions to Download

First install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) then clone this repo (watch [example](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop)).


(Important) After that you have to add the created folder as Daz library, like this.
