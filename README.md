# First steps

## Download Assert

* Download this project (https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/ABFD-scene-posing) so you can share your work.

## How to download updates
Assert updates will **not** happen by themselves, therefore: Every so often you have to open GitHub Desktop and download updates.    
**GitHub does not always report that there are updates to be made (this depends on how long it stays open)**,   
so I recommend that you perform the following process every month, and in case you miss something:
1) click  in the upper right
2) the list of what you have downloaded will appear,
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67595890/190847025-ac4c7fdf-5ef0-4954-ab3b-0128060f1887.png)
3) click  the name of the first 'assert' and now you have to click  1-2 twice the big button in the top center.
4) Do step 3 again for the whole item.


## Connect them to daz:
Open Settings

1) creates a working environment
2) select it
3) click on Daz Studio Format
4) Add all the assert paths you downloaded. (make sure they are all) + **'My DAZ 3D Library'** folder (the deafult folder of daz)
