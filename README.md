First of all, all scenes can only include material from one of these repos, https://github.com/DRincs-Productions?q=daz&type=all&language=&sort= (if you find other useful material request it from me [here](Request-new-material) )



## Instructions (for those unfamiliar with Git)

First install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) then clone this repo (watch [example](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop)).


(Important) After that you have to add the created folder as Daz library, like this.

## Request new material
If you need new assert or found out about the new best assert which should replace the existing one: you can request it [here](https://github.com/DonRP/ABFD-assert-posing/issues/new/choose)
