# First steps 

* First of all, all scenes can only include material from one of these repos, https://github.com/DRincs-Productions?q=daz&type=all&language=&sort= (if you find other useful material request it from me [here](request-new-material) )
* Download this project through [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) so you can share your work. [READ MORE](Instructions-to-Download)
* (Recommended) In case you are working on several projects, I recommend splitting the assert folders, as shown below:

* The following repos will also be essential:
  - https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/ABFD-assert (Where the characters and environments will be)
  - https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/daz-assert-pose#readme (for you fundamental)
  - https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/daz-assert-props-pose (for you fundamental)
  - https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/daz-assert-character-tool (assert employees)
  - https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/daz-assert-character-ABFD#readme  (assert employees) Ã¨ un progetto di >20GB
  - https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/daz-assert-home  (assert employees)

Here All:
https://github.com/orgs/DRincs-Productions/projects/1/views/1

* Choose a ticket in TODO 
* assign it:![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67595890/187976846-b96bd4fe-2776-40ac-81b4-ceb79805a2ce.png)
* drag it into 'In Progress'
* create your line of work ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67595890/187976886-f5693b2c-53c0-439c-af06-a772a3a9faf0.png)
* [move to your branch from GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project#choosing-a-branch-and-making-changes)
* creates a new folder into which it places your work.
* routinely uploads changes:  [include-in-a-commit](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project#selecting-changes-to-include-in-a-commit) & [Upload](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project#write-a-commit-message-and-push-your-changes) (no we have scattering problems)
* if you have problems comment in the ticket
* Once finished drag it in 'to test'

## What will happen to the scenes then
* will be copied into another final project, where they will be completed and refined.
* Then rendered with an iray server
