* (Recommended) In case you are working on several projects, I recommend splitting the assert folders, as shown below:

* The following repos will also be essential:
  * <https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/ABFD-assert> (Where the characters and environments will be)
  * <https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/daz-assert-pose#readme> (*all pose*, for you fundamental)
  * <https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/daz-assert-props-pose> (*props and pose*, for you fundamental)
  * https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/daz-assert-sexual (*sex pose*, for you fundamental)
  * <https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/daz-assert-home>  (*home pose* & assert employees)
  * <https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/daz-assert-character-tool> (assert employees)
  * <https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/daz-assert-character-ABFD#readme>  (assert employees) is a project of  >20GB
* all scenes can only include material from one of these repos, <https://github.com/DRincs-Productions?q=daz&type=all&language=&sort>= (if you find other useful material request it from me [here](#request-new-material) )

## Instructions (for those unfamiliar with Git)

First install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) then clone this repo (watch [example](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop)).

(Important) After that you have to add the created folder as Daz library, like this.

## Request new material

If you need an Assert that is not included in this folder try checking in these bookmarks: [raindrop](https://raindrop.io/drincs)
in case you find what you needed or not, request to add a new Assert [here](https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/daz-assert-posing/issues/new/choose).
