* (Recommended) In case you are working on several projects, I recommend splitting the assert folders, as shown below:

* The following repos will also be essential:
  * <https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/ABFD-assert> (Where the characters and environments will be)
  * <https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/daz-assert-pose#readme> (**all pose**, for you fundamental)
  * <https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/daz-assert-props-pose> (**props and pose**, for you fundamental)
  * https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/daz-assert-sexual (**sex pose**, for you fundamental)
  * <https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/daz-assert-home>  (**home pose** & assert employees)
  * <https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/daz-assert-character-tool> (assert employees)
  * https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/daz-assert-texture (assert employees)
  * <https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/daz-assert-character-ABFD#readme>  (assert employees) is a project of  >20GB
* all scenes can only include material from one of these repos, <https://github.com/DRincs-Productions?q=daz&type=all&language=&sort>= (if you find other useful material request it from me [here](#request-new-material) )

in case you find what you needed or not, request to add a new Assert [here](https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/daz-assert-posing/issues/new/choose).
